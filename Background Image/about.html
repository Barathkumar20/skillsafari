Advantages of Water villas Packages in Maldives:
Complete Privacy: Owing to their location, overwater villas inherently offer an increased level of privacy. There is more room to hide away from prying eyes and relax in a secluded atmosphere over the lagoon. If you are looking for even more privacy then opt for accommodations that are further from other rooms, villas, etc.

Access to water: The whole concept of water villas is based on ease of access to the waters underneath them. So, if you like water-based activities like snorkelling etc it would be fruitful to look into the options closer to reefs.

Calm rest: If you are a light sleeper then we suggest you opt for stays that are situated far off from sources of noise like bars or pubs etc.

Sunrises and Sunsets: Sunrises and sunsets don’t get any better than they do in the Maldives. So, spend some extra time ( and money, if your budget allows ) to opt for accommodation that offers both sunrise and sunset views.

Following is a list of points that one should actively keep an eye out for while opting for any water villa packages:
Distance from the coast: Overwater villas tend to be located far off from the coast in some cases. In such a scenario, frequent commutes can be a hassle, so we suggest that you look out for the best option available to you.

Terrace: Terraces are available in most cases, but we suggest you look for terraces with a shaded section too so that you can move your sun lounger to a cooler section should the temperatures get too hot.

Private pool: If your budget allows for it, then we suggest you opt for villas that come bundled with access to a private pool. Not only will this add to your experience but it will also be the envy of all your friends back home.

House reef: If you plan to swim in the waters around your villa then it makes sense to explore the house reef below beforehand. After all, the more gorgeous the reef, the more fun you will have snorkelling in the waters.
